IMAGECRYPT - Design, Verification and Implementation of Image Encryption and Decryption using Advanced Encryption Standard(AES)


The image is first converted into a binary file, after which the binary data is transmitted to the FPGA via the UART protocol. Upon reception, the data is securely encrypted using AES encryption standard and subsequently stored in memory. The system allows seamless access to both encrypted and decrypted data through a switch interface. Decryption is permitted only when the correct cryptographic key is provided, ensuring data security. This project demonstrates hardware-based cryptographic security and high-speed data transmission.
